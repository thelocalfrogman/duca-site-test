                We’re the team that makes everything look fun and exciting! We spread the word about our events,
                projects, and wins so everyone feels welcome and included.

                    In the Advertising Division, we love bringing the club’s personality to life! We design posters,
                    write easy-to-read announcements, and create social media posts that help everyone feel connected
                    and excited about what’s coming up. We work with other divisions to make sure everyone’s hard work
                    gets the spotlight it deserves. You don’t need to be a design pro — just someone who enjoys being
                    creative and helping the club feel warm and inviting. If you like making things look awesome or
                    enjoy sharing good vibes with others, we'd be so happy to have you join us!
