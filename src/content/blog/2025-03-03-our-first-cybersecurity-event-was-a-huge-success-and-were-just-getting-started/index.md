Last week, we held our very first event at Deakin, and we are still amazed by the incredible turnout. The enthusiasm, curiosity, and energy in the room made it clear that cybersecurity is a growing passion for many students. Seeing so many of you engage with our vision, meet our team, and learn about what we’re building was truly inspiring.

This event was just the beginning. We wanted to introduce not only who we are but also how DUCA (Deakin University Cybersecurity Association) is here to support students at every stage of their cybersecurity journey. Whether you’re just starting out or already deep into the field, our goal is to create a space where everyone can learn, grow, and find valuable opportunities.

#### What Happened at Our First Event?

Our launch event was designed to set the stage for what’s ahead. We introduced our four key divisions, which form the foundation of our activities:

- **Cyber Essentials**: Aimed at those who are new to cybersecurity, this division focuses on the fundamental concepts and best practices to build a strong foundation.
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges**: A hands-on, competitive way to sharpen your hacking and problem-solving skills while learning to think like a cybersecurity professional.
- **Penetration Testing**: For those interested in ethical hacking and security testing, this division explores how to identify vulnerabilities and defend against cyber threats.
- **Networking and Career Growth**: Cybersecurity is about more than just technical skills. Building connections with like-minded individuals and industry professionals is a key part of career success.

We designed these divisions to ensure that no matter what area of cybersecurity interests you, there is something valuable for you at DUCA.

Missed the Event? No Problem!

If you weren’t able to make it to our launch event, don’t worry. We host workshops every Friday, covering a wide range of topics to help you build your skills and stay ahead of the curve before graduation. Our workshops include:

- Cybersecurity fundamentals and best practices
- Hands-on Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges
- Penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques

These sessions are a great way to gain practical experience, meet fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts, and learn from experts in the field.

In fact, we are thrilled to announce that we welcomed over 90 new members to the DUCA community this week alone! 🤯 It’s truly inspiring to see so many passionate individuals join our growing network of aspiring cyber professionals.
